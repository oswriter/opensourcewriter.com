Last year I found a boxed set of Corel Linux (c. 1999) at a library sale. Aside from the DVDs containing ancient software--e.g., the Linux 2.2 kernel, Netscape Navigator--the most interesting thing was the nicely printed user manual, which was several hundred pages in length. Today, many Linux distributions don't even bother with good online documentation, even to guide new users on installation.

That's why I was pleased to see the recent publication of Larry Bushey's [*Ubuntu MATE: Upgrading from Windows or OSX*](https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/731432). Bushey is the longtime co-host of the [Going Linux](http://goinglinux.com/about.html) podcast, which is itself a terrific resource for anyone looking to get started with open source software.  In this short self-published book--the physical copy I ordered via [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Ubuntu-MATE-Upgrading-Windows-OSX-ebook/dp/B074JGLB4H) is only 65 pages--Bushey may not have replicated an old-style user manual, but he offers a solid guide to getting started with Ubuntu MATE, which has emerged as one of the most popular Linux-based operating systems for new users.

As the book's subtitle suggests, Bushey focuses on showing Windows and macOS (formerly OSX) users how to transition to Ubuntu MATE. He walks through each of the key programs included with the distribution. There's also a handy chart mapping several common application and window shortcuts to their counterparts in the other operating systems. Finally, there are detailed instructions for downloading and installing Ubuntu MATE.

There's not much new information in this book for Linux veterans. But if you know someone who is unhappy with their current operating system and looking for information about Linux, Bushey's monograph is a good starting point. *Ubuntu MATE: Upgrading from Windows or OSX* is currently available from Smashwords and Amazon in printed or multiple ebook formats for $9.99.
