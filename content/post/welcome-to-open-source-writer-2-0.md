I started using open source software about five years ago. I was looking for an alternative to Microsoft Office on the Mac and came across [NeoOffice](https://www.neooffice.org/neojava/en/index.php), a fork of the Apache [OpenOffice](https://www.openoffice.org/) project. Eventually I decided to move away from the Mac platform altogether and try Linux, specifically [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com).

Over the years I've worked with a number of a Linux distributions. Some have proven more successful than others. After an extended stint on [Ubuntu MATE](https://start.ubuntu-mate.org/), I moved all of my work machines to [Solus](https://solus-project.com/) in early 2017.

## Why Solus?

Solus is an independent Linux operating system started in 2012 by [Ikey Doherty](https://github.com/ikeydoherty), a software engineer at Intel. Unlike many Linux distributions, including Ubuntu, Solus is built "from scratch," meaning it does not rely on any other project's pre-built software packages. The Solus Project manages everything internally, from compiling the Linux kernel to providing its own desktop environment called [Budgie](https://budgie-desktop.org/home/).

I switched to Solus for two main reasons. First, it is a desktop-specific operating system. Linux is based on UNIX, which was originally developed for large mainframes with multiple user workstations. Even today, Linux is more widely used on servers than laptops and desktop PCs. Indeed, most of the well-known Linux distributions support both server and desktop use.

But Solus is for the desktop only. (Doherty says Solus is for "home computing.") This works out great since I happen to be a desktop user. Server-based Linux distributions have their place--this blog is running on an Ubuntu server--but they are not optimized for home computing as well as Solus. I'm running Solus on three laptops with different specifications and have never had a smoother experience in terms of performance and lack of hardware issues.

The second reason I moved to Solus is its release schedule--or more precisely, its lack of one. Last year [Solus moved to a "rolling release" model](https://solus-project.com/2016/07/10/this-week-in-solus-install-31/), so once you install the operating system, it is supported and updated indefinitely.


## Why This Blog?

I previously published an **Open Source Writer** blog in 2016. That site covered a variety of subjects related to software and the law. (My professional background is that of a [blog ghostwriter](https://skipoliva.com) for law firms.) In reviving this blog, I decided to highlight the wide variety of software available for Solus.

Solus gets a bum rap in some corners of the Linux press for "not having enough software." It's true that Solus does not match the sheer number of packages offered by Ubuntu or [Debian](https://debian.org). But Doherty and the Solus developers choose to emphasize quality over quantity.

The truth is, most of us only use a tiny fraction of the total packages available for any operating system. In terms of applications--as opposed to the desktop or system libraries--I probably use no more than a dozen programs regularly. And I don't need Solus to offer ten applications that do the exact same thing.

To help combat the "lack of Solus packages" myth, and promote the great work of the people who develop open source software, I plan to do one post each week on an application available through the Solus Software Center. My current plan is to alternate between writing about software I already use and trying out programs that are "new" to me. At least at the outset I'm going to try a 2-to-1 ratio of old-to-new applications.
