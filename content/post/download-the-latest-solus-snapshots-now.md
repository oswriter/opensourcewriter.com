Today the [Solus Project released new installation snapshots](https://solus-project.com/2017/04/18/solus-releases-iso-snapshot-20170418-0/) for its Budgie and MATE editions, as well as its first GNOME-based version. Solus concurrently released [Budgie Desktop 10.3](https://budgie-desktop.org), the last major update before the developers begin work on Budgie 11.

Obviously, free software is not free to produce or maintain. Ikey Doherty and the Solus team have put hundreds of hours into this latest update. To help out with the costs of getting today's snapshots to the public, I've set up a separate [download mirror](https://appealsblog.com/) for all three versions. This site is running on a New York-based [Digital Ocean droplet](https://www.digitalocean.com/), so if you're in the eastern United States, please consider downloading from there and sparing the poor overworked Solus servers.
