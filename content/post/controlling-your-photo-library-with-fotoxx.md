I was implementing a new template for my [professional website](https://skipoliva.com) last week and needed to crop some images. I've never been terribly good with image software, but fortunately I found a fairly straightforward program called [Fotoxx](http://www.kornelix.net/fotoxx/fotoxx.html) in the [Solus](https://solus-project.com) Software Center. Fotoxx is really geared towards photo management, but it works well as a basic image editor.

## Simple Interface, Complex Tools

Fotoxx has a very simple interface. An icon bar on the left side of the screen functions as the menu. Image files contained in system folders are displayed as a thumbnail gallery.

Once you select an image, there's a wide variety of tools available. In my case I just needed to crop images. But you can do everything from adjust colors, sharpness, and brightness to applying special effects. Among the more interesting effects I tried was converting a full-color photograph to a black-and-white line drawing and then placing the two images side-by-side in a "panorama":

Fotoxx also lets you edit the metadata of your image files. This includes tagging an image to a specific geographic location. These tags can then be displayed on a built-in world map feature (which uses [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)). By clicking a location on the map, as marked by a red spot, you can instantly view the tagged photos. Metadata also enables you to search photos by categories or date.

One final notable feature of Fotoxx: You can instantly create slideshows from a folder or selection of images. There are a couple of dozen transition animations available, and you can even add a music file to play during the slideshow. 

## Who Is Behind Fotoxx?

Fotoxx celebrated its most recent release (v. 17.04) on April 1. [Solus](https://git.solus-project.com/packages/fotoxx) currently has the 17.01 release available. Fotoxx is also widely available for Ubuntu-, Debian-, and Fedora-based systems. The creator and lead developer is [Michael Cornelison](https://kornelix.blogspot.com/). He's made Fotoxx available under the [GNU General Public License v. 3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).
